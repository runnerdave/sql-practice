# SQL practice
* Sakila database is used in may examples, the schema is shown in the file: Database-Schema.png
* Postgres database used, in personal mac installed with homebrew
* For database admin tasks pgAdmin3 is used
* To load the Sakila database use the file: dvdrental.tar restoring it into a new database
* The .sql files are:
  * sql_bootcamp.sql, contains sql scripts used through the bootcamp, from selects all the way to joins
  * assessment2-bookings.sql, contains the solutions to the assessment 2, the questions are in the script as comments.
    * to solve the assessment2 create a database in postgres and load the exercises-assessment-2.tar file using a restore command,
      it does not use the Sakila database but a bookings database
